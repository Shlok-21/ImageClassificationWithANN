# Image Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for image classification. The primary focus is to understand the fundamentals of ANN, get the basics correct, and explore its limitations in tasks such as image classification compared to more advanced techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Motivation
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been a cornerstone in machine learning and artificial intelligence for several decades. They offer a powerful framework for modeling complex relationships within data. However, when it comes to tasks like image classification, ANN may not perform as well as specialized architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project seeks to explore the reasons behind this discrepancy and to understand why ANN might not be the best choice for image classification tasks.

## Key Objectives
1. **Learn ANN Fundamentals:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of how Artificial Neural Networks work, including their architecture, training process, and optimization techniques.
2. **Master Basics:** Focus on getting the basics of ANN implementation correct, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
3. **Explore Limitations:** Identify the limitations of ANN in image classification tasks and compare its performance with more suitable alternatives like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
   
## Why ANN is not good for Image Classification?
While ANN can theoretically be used for image classification tasks, they might not be the most efficient choice due to several reasons:
- **Limited Spatial Understanding:** ANN does not inherently understand the spatial relationships within images, making it less effective in capturing features like edges, textures, and shapes.
- **High Dimensionality:** Images are high-dimensional data, and processing them directly with ANN can lead to computational inefficiency and overfitting.
- **Lack of Feature Hierarchies:** ANN might struggle to learn hierarchical features present in images, which are crucial for accurate classification.

## Why CNN is Better for Image Classification?
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have emerged as the preferred choice for image classification due to several advantages:
- **Learned Hierarchical Features:** CNNs are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of features within images, making them highly effective for tasks like object recognition.
- **Spatial Understanding:** CNNs utilize convolutional layers, which enable them to capture spatial patterns and relationships within images more effectively.
- **Parameter Efficiency:** CNN architectures are specifically optimized for processing images, resulting in more efficient parameter usage and better generalization performance.
